        <span style="vertical-align: middle;font-size: 20px;">My name is Michael Guadagni and to the left is a picture of myself
          when I was in Block Island last summer. I am currently 21 years old and live in East Greenwich, Rhode Island. I have lived
        in this town for all life and have only left on a few occasions. I just graduated from the University of Rhode Island in the 
        spring of 2021 with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering. In the past year, I have found my passion of coding and 
        programming. I am now taking a few programming classes at URI to eventually obtain a Masters degree in computer science. My 
        end goal is to become a succesful software engineer.</span>
